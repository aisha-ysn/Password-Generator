These are to criteria options that the user is presented with when the click the 'generate password' button for the first time.

This is how the generated password is displayed to the user.

The generator also has a 'copy' button which copies the password to the user's clipboard once is has been clicked; the user is also given a confirmation alert.


If no criteria has been selected the user is asked to 'Please Select Required Criteria'.

The Generator is also responsive and able to adapt to different screen sizes (compatible with mobiles).
